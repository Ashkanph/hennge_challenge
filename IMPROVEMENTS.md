## Mission 3: Improvements (What I can think of)
* First of all, it would be more comfortable to use tools like Figma or Zeplin.
* I used a date range picker library for selecting the dates; I think there is a need to have a design for it (I prefer the range picker calendar in mobile size to be full-screen).
* I think there is a need for a loading icon for when we change the dates till the result is loaded (It would be good for when we get the results from the backend).
* I think it would be good to have a design system for the atomic elements (and typography) and also a dark theme (I mean both light and dark themes).
* I think it would be better to open the emails in a new page (like Gmail); It would make it easier for developers to use libraries like [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) for when the number of results is too big.
* There is no need for the `(s)` in the `Results: 0 mail(s)` when there is 0 results; The developer can handle the `s`;
* And honestly, my design for the mail body is not good; But this is what I could afford in the limited time I had (I worked on this challenge in my spare time).
