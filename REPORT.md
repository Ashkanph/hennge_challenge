**Note**: Please note that to see the build version you should use a local server; In vscode, you can use [Live Server extension](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server).
* You can see the **source codes** in the `dev` branch of the repository.


## What I did for the Mission 1, 2 and 3:
The steps resulted to the final SPA application:
* Initialize a simple react project with [cra redux template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux/).
* Adding new favicon and logos and removed the default cra codes.
* Adding `styled-components` (for styles), `react-intl` (In case we needed to support i18n in future) and some libraries (`lint-staged`, `pre-commit` and `prettier`) to prettify my codes automatically before each commit.
* Set styled-components theme (light) and English locale for i18n
* Using Helvetica fonts (Couldn't purchase the font legally)
* Adding [@wojtekmaj/react-daterange-picker](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-daterange-picker) for date range picker
* Creating separate components for the page
* Adding [mock data file](https://github.com/Ashkanph/hennge_challenge/blob/dev/src/static/mockData.js)
* Adding function of the page and sorting (columns of date and from)
* Make the page responsive
* Creating the build version, Adding `IMPROVEMENTS.md` and `REPORT.md`.
